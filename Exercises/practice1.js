    Case 1: Summation of every number from 1
    Your manager asked you to create a simple algorithm that finds the summation of every number from 1 to any number given. 
    The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.
    let num = 2; // 1 + 2 = 3
    let num = 10; // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
*/

let total = 0;
let num = 11;

for(let i = 1; i <= num; i++){
    total += i;
}

console.log(`The summation of ${num} is ${total}`);
